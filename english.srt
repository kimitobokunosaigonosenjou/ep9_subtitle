1
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,620
Are you saying you don't know who this man is?

2
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,330
He's the most wretched demon
that went against the late queen!

3
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,830
I have to do this in order to go home.

4
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,370
I want you to make a promise.

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:43,910
If I defeat him, you won't stop me
and my friends until we cross the border.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,040
I'll take that as an acceptance.

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,370
I fail to understand.

8
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,200
Why would someone from the Empire
protect her? And why go against me?

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,740
No matter. Your answer means nothing either way.

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,240
I'll crush you.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,620
Be quick with the rescue!

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,580
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

13
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:59,540
So this is where you were. The alert
hasn't been called off. Please come inside.

14
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,990
What's going on, Schwartz?

15
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,910
We believe the Empire's assassination force
was spotted within our nation.

16
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:15,490
During which time, Salinger the Demon
has broken free from the Alcatroz prison.

17
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:22,040
We are immediately investigating
if the two cases are related.

18
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,790
I see.

19
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,200
There is one thing that concerns me.

20
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,290
I am told Princess Aliceliese is there
taking command herself.

21
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,830
It seems too much of a coincidence
that she just happens to be there.

22
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,740
My sister Alice is there?

23
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,410
Hm. I can't say no one has ever blocked
my astral art, Roaring Song,

24
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,040
but to be physically sliced is a first.

25
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,950
Sound astral spirits are invisible
and destructive energy.

26
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,080
You couldn't possibly slice it with a sword.

27
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
It may be invisible, but not right now.

28
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,790
From the flickering of the flames?

29
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:16,290
You've heightened your senses
to notice such things? How is that?

30
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,370
I wasn't born with this ability.

31
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:26,910
A circus act or an act of god?
A fluke or a talent?

32
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,580
I suppose figuring it out
could be interesting.

33
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,910
Imperial swordsman, keep your guard up!

34
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,740
His astral spirit is water reflection.
It captures astral spirits and steals--

35
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,830
Rin!

36
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,950
Do not ruin this, maid. I'm playing
with this swordsman right now.

37
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,120
Good reflex. How did you judge that one?

38
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,540
Instinct.

39
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,540
But that will only go so far.
You won't last long.

40
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,660
You're wrong.

41
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Hm?

42
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,490
I'll finish this quickly.

43
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,120
Are you a beast in human's clothing?!

44
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,160
That gave me a fright.

45
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,830
A barrier of wind?

46
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,370
You lost your one in a million chance.
Your swords will never reach me again.

47
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,240
No, next time, I'll cut through the barrier!

48
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,540
Crawl on the ground, beast.

49
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,830
Astral spirit of exploding earth, blast up
and scorch the earth with your rage!

50
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830
Jump!

51
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,240
I owe you.

52
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,290
I had no choice. It means nothing.

53
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,660
I despise saying this,
but you being here is a godsend.

54
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,660
I'm unsure how many more cards he has
up his sleeve, but we'll keep pushing!

55
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,540
How many more cards?

56
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:26,740
I've yet to show any of my cards
in the last 30 years.

57
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,870
Listen well, maid and Imperial swordsman.

58
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,200
Astral spirit's true power is
far greater than you can imagine.

59
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,830
You shall perish after getting
a glimpse of its depth...!

60
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,990
Emergency response teams, search for Salinger!

61
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,370
Police officers will rescue the injured!
I will deal with the fire!

62
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,120
All prison guards will join
the search for Salinger!

63
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,410
We cannot let that demon escape! We must--

64
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,870
It's pointless.

65
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,330
He will not stop, because no one can stop him.

66
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,160
Saint Disciple, Nameless.

67
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,330
This is my nation. A lowly assassin
is not welcome here.

68
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,410
How ludicrous for a witch to call me lowly.

69
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:31,160
Is this your doing? Did you attack
the prison to release Salinger?

70
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,700
Does that matter right now?
Focus on what's in front of you.

71
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,540
The prison tower is in flames,

72
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,330
and Salinger the Transcendent will once again
bring havoc to the Sovereignty.

73
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,830
That's what matters.

74
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,370
I'll stop him.

75
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,740
Will you, now?

76
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,410
Pierce through!

77
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,990
Did you think you had the home advantage?

78
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,870
You don't seem like yourself, either.
Give me everything you've got!

79
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,330
As you wish.

80
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,620
Once Salinger gets through here.

81
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,790
My mission ends here.

82
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,290
Nameless!

83
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,290
Salinger?!

84
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,040
Astral spirit of water reflection...

85
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,200
This astral spirit splits another
astral spirit into two.

86
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,450
Fire and water, earth and wind, yin and yang.

87
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,290
By combining the two contradictory concepts,
they're raised to a higher level.

88
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,790
This is the state of equilibrium that
no individual astral spirit can attain.

89
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,790
Freezing fire!

90
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,660
Fall back, Rin!

91
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,490
The blaze grew stronger?!

92
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,910
You disrupted the balance between
fire and ice. That was a mistake.

93
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,490
Die.

94
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,410
Iska!

95
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,740
Salinger... Is this the reason why
you collect astral spirits?!

96
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,200
My reason? This is just a by-product.

97
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,080
Combining one astral spirit with another
is within the realms of an astral mage.

98
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,580
What I see on the horizon
is something much further.

99
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,790
My goal is to combine
humans with astral spirits.

100
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,240
Fusion between humans and astral spirits?!

101
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,540
Only two people have reached that level
in history. One was Founder Nebulis.

102
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,200
The Founder?!

103
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,040
I will surpass the earthly concept
of a king and I will reach that level.

104
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,330
You're insane.

105
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,540
Salinger, you're an enemy to the royal family.
You must be stopped!

106
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,290
You still wish to fight?
You've seen how that swordsman died.

107
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,950
You know nothing about Iska.

108
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:38,490
My master, Princess Aliceliese,
acknowledged him as her only rival.

109
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,620
Furthermore, he defeated the Founder,
someone you see as an equal.

110
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,290
Hmm? He defeated the Founder?
You must be lying.

111
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,330
It'd take more than an attack
like that to take Iska down.

112
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,790
All I had to do was listen to your
high-and-mighty speech and stall.

113
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,200
Enough. I've grown tired of your face.
Let me end you, too.

114
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,450
I'm over here, Demon!

115
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,490
Impossible!

116
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,700
You couldn't have survived that!

117
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,330
These astral swords are a pair of two.

118
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:31,160
The black sword cuts astral arts,
and the white sword replicates it once!

119
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,330
Are you saying...

120
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:52,450
...you used the frigid ice and
froze yourself to escape the blaze?

121
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,950
Have you lost your mind?

122
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,330
I have determination.

123
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:03,120
She trusted me, and I won't let her down!

124
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,580
Determination? Nonsense!
You're just an abominable berserker!

125
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,120
Air and lightning, maddeningly dance for me!

126
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,700
A sandstorm?!

127
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,040
Earth, form a pillar!

128
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,700
Rin?!

129
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,950
Don't worry about me! You have to defeat him!

130
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,740
How dare you, maid?!

131
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,370
What?!

132
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,450
What are you doing to my Rin?

133
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,790
Lady Alice...

134
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,540
You did well, Rin. Thank you for hanging on.

135
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,910
Iska... I knew you'd help me.

136
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,410
You're done, Demon!

137
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,040
Don't be so sure, you fool!

138
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,950
A mere swordsman could never elevate
to my height! I will not accept it!

139
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,290
How amusing! Fate has brought forth
a formidable opponent

140
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,410
in an attempt to stop me from reaching
great heights as an astral mage.

141
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:55,490
Mark my words! Nothing can hold me down!

142
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,410
Lady Alice, we've completed
the confirmation of prisoners.

143
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,990
They're all accounted for.

144
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,290
I see. That's a relief.

145
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,790
Rin, how's your injury?

146
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm fine.

147
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,950
Oh? Then what about this scratch?

148
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,620
Ow! What was that for?!

149
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,490
You don't have to act stoic. This is me
you're talking to. Just be honest.

150
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,540
It hurts a little.

151
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,830
Good girl.

152
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,450
So, what's the situation like?

153
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,620
Right. Things have settled down around the site,

154
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,200
and the Imperial soldiers have likely retreated.

155
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,540
We have already briefed Her Majesty, but...

156
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,290
All right. I'll give her the full detail
once we're back at the palace.

157
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,620
Iska... He could have escaped
as soon as he unlocked his handcuffs.

158
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,160
But he didn't...

159
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,790
I kept my promise. We're good, right?

160
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,910
No, but that wasn't right!

161
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,540
Lady Alice?

162
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,370
I almost said thank you, but that wasn't right!

163
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,160
Because those were the terms of exchange!
Iska was obligated to come!

164
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,240
All right, let's go home! There's so much
I need to report to Mother!

165
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,870
O-Of course.

166
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,450
You struggled more than I thought you would.

167
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,910
Holy smokes, I'm burning up!
I thought I was gonna die from heat stroke.

168
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,200
I'm never, ever going to wear
a completely airtight metal fiber again!

169
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,620
I couldn't fight for more than a few minutes.
I wore out and took off!

170
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Risya, you don't even need a toy like that.

171
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,660
All part of my research.
Anyway, how'd your end go?

172
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,910
Two special forces succeeded
in infiltrating the Central Province.

173
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,620
Surveillance of the palace is possible.

174
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,330
Oh, that's great.

175
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,410
I bet that'll put the Eight Great Apostles
in a good mood for about three days.

176
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,990
What about reporting to the Emperor?

177
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,080
Yup, gotta do that ASAP.

178
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,240
The Emperor's unusually interested
in Successor of the Black Steel, Iska.

179
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,450
Risya and Nameless have returned.

180
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,910
The Nebulis Sovereignty is pretty shaken up
from the Salinger the Demon ordeal.

181
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,080
So far, so good.

182
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,870
It would be ideal if the purebred
would be captured, but...

183
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,950
Things are moving our way.

184
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,950
What a relief! Going in was hard
but getting out's a piece of cake!

185
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,660
I was surprised to learn you guys
were in the Sovereignty.

186
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,580
Actually, it's very surprising that you
were able to cross the border.

187
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:30,490
Yeah, talk about small mercies.
We couldn't have done it any other way.

188
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,700
The special op?

189
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,910
Right. According to Risya, our astral crests
will disappear in a few days.

190
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,040
That's cutting it close.

191
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,990
I see.

192
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,660
Are you tired, too, Iska?

193
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,370
Oh, no, I'm fine. I can push through
until we return to the Empire.

194
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,410
Though, I am tired.

195
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,660
Wait, it's Alice's fault that I'm so tired!

196
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,740
Iska? What is it?

197
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,740
Oh, no, nothing at all!

198
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,660
I'm glad you seem to be doing okay, Captain.

199
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,450
Me? I'm doing fine!

200
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:26,910
Oh, um, was the whole astral crest thing
resolved while I was gone?

201
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,740
Captain?

202
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,450
No! Stop! Don't remind me!
I haven't been able to process it yet!

203
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,580
You'd forgotten about it?

204
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,950
I was too worried about you, Iska!

205
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,040
You need to help me think of
a plan when we get back!

206
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,620
Oh, yes, of course!

207
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,240
It's my turn to help you now, Captain.

208
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,990
Rin, you fought well this time.
I'm proud of you as your master.

209
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,950
I-I am humbled by your kind words!

210
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,120
Rin?

211
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:10,540
W-Well, I may not have been able
to deal with it on my own this time.

212
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,040
You're right.

213
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,330
Then, what do you think of me?
Aside from being a witch?

214
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,540
A rival on the battlefield.

215
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,080
Iska...

216
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Lady Alice, did I just hear an unsettling name?

217
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,540
I-It's fine! Iska and I are official!
We're officially rivals!

218
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,620
It's okay to say his name!

219
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,370
It's a huge problem!

220
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,870
However, that Imperial swordsman
did save my life.

221
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,200
I must admit, however reluctantly,
that while he is our enemy,

222
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,080
he's also a respectable warrior...

223
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Rin! So you officially approve, too!

224
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,040
But I still cannot allow it. You cannot say
that Imperial swordsman's name.

225
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,580
Especially in the Sovereignty.

226
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,990
But...

227
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,990
I'll tell Her Majesty.

228
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,700
Fine.

229
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Wh-What is it?

230
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,580
Really, you worry too much, Rin.

231
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,490
I'm only stating the obvious!

232
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,120
Yeah, yeah. You sure are dependable.

233
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,580
Iska? Imperial soldier?

234
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,990
An imperial soldier that Alice
is interested in? Her rival?

235
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,910
Iska. Iska.

236
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,160
No... This can't be... That's impossible...

237
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:02,990
Fate of the stars, I will not
succumb to your temptation.

238
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,410
But if I could see him again...

239
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,450
Please help me, once more...

240
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,040
Paradise:
Iska
